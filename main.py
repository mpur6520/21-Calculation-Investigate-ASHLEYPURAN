#analyze a code and answer questions to better understand arithmetic expressions + how they work with user inputs and variables

# Starter code

num1 = 25 #create varuable num1 and assign value of 25 to it
num2 = 4 #create variable num2 and assign value of 4 to it
print("Enter a number") #output text "enter a number" prompt
num3 = int(input()) #create a variable to store user's response to prompt called num3, changes default string to an integer to store

total1 = num1 * num2 #create variable to hold called total1, the product of num1 and num2 which is 100
total2 = num3 + num2 #create variable called total2 to hold the sum of num3 (number the user inputted) and num2 (4) 
total3 = total1 - total2 #create variable called total3 to hold the difference of total1 and total2

# How many variables are used in the code?
  # Answer: 6 variables are used in the code, num1, num2, num3, total1, total2, and total3.

# Give the line number where an output statement is used.
  # Answer: Line 5 has an output statement to ask the user to enter a number on screen.

# What symbol is used for variable assignment?
  # Answer: The equal sign (=) is used for variable assignments.

# What value is stored in total1 at the end of the program?
  # Answer: 100 is stored in total1 at the end of the program.

# What value is stored in num3 at the end of the program?
  # Answer: num3 is assigned the value the user inputs into the program once it runs.

# Line 8 is changed to total1 = num1 // num2. How would it affect the program?
  # Answer: Nothing changes on the output side. It changes the result of variable total3, assigning the value of 6 to total1 rather than 100.
